# 42_Berlin subject training

This repository contains my personal approaches to 42 Subjects I didn't finish at the piscine or want to redo.
If you are a student, take this only as an inspiration and take the effort to find the solution yourself. That said. My solution is working. However it does not follow the 42 linting standards. So I did not check with norminette or moulinette. It is pretty sure not the most efficient or cleanest solution out there. This is just training for me and not to copy/paste for you.
